# Trying to automate fishing game task

Description:
In the game 'metin2' there's a fishing minigame, where you have to click a fish 3 times when the fish is in a specific area. I intend to automate this task using my knowledge in problem solving.

Challenges:

1. Detect fish
2. Detect when fish in area
3. Click on fish
4. Detect when a fish has been caught
5. Reput bait

Solutions:

1. Apply masks to highlight the fish in a cropped screenshot
2. Mask a radius inside the area
3. Use win32api library
4. Don't know yet (maybe will opt for timers)
5. Use kb input library

Packages:

1. Numpy
2. CV2
3. Mouse
4. Some random kb input library
